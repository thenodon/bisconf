System requirements
-------------------

Installation
============
Install from source
-------------------
Download Bisconf from http://gforge.ingby.com/gf/project/bischeck/frs/ or check 
out the bisconf trunk or tag (0.3.0) if you want to hack it.

Make sure you copy the bischeck-0.4.3.jar and the quartz-2.1.5.jar from the 
Bischeck lib to the the checked out bisconf lib directory.

If code is checkout by svn you can build a distribution by:

$ export PLAY_PATH=

$ $PLAY_PATH/play dependencies

$ ant dist 

If you check out the code and like to use eclipse you can run bisconf directly 
from the eclipse. Check out the home page of play! for more info, 
http://www.playframework.org/documentation/1.2.4/


Install binary distribution
---------------------------
To install the distribution extract the tar file downloaded or built by ant 
(located in the target directory). From the distribution directory run:

$ chmod 755 install

$ sudo ./install -u

This will present the installation options. Sudo is required since init scripts 
are installed in /etc/init.d.


Bischeck JMX integration
========================
Bisconf communicate with the Bischeck daemon over JMX using the RMI protocol. 
This means that Bischeck must have been installed with the option that define 
hostname or IP and a RMI port. If the installation was done without these 
options it can simply be altered by editing the bischeck script in the Bischeck 
installation bin directory. For more information please read the Bischeck 
documentation.

To configure the Bischeck JMX service for Bisconf please edit the file jmx.xml 
located in the etc directory of the Bisconf installation. Default hostname is 
localhost and port is 3333.

Currently Bisconf and Bischeck must run on the same server.
